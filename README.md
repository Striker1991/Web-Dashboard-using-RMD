# Web-Dashboard-using-RMD
This repository contains the code set in R (.rmd file) which uses rainfall and some prediction data to plot a web dashboard showing all the parts of India where rainfall is predicted for D+3 and D+4 days and the corresponding impact of the rainfall on those areas. I have used the latitudes and longitudes over India shape file for plotting.
